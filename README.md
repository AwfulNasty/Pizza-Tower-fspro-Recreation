# Pizza Tower FMOD Studio Project Recreation
This project aims to make modding sounds easier with FMOD Studio by recreating the Pizza Tower FMOD Studio Project, allowing for any custom thing to be added!

## Opening the project with FMOD Studio
Before opening this, extract your Pizza Tower banks files at `sound\Desktop` to wav with the [Unofficial FMOD Banks Tool](https://gamebanana.com/tools/12100)

Put it into the repository `Assets` folder, and you should be good to go to open this with FMOD Studio!
